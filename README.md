# Work-Day-Scheduler

This repository is for a work day scheduler web application.     
In this work day scheduler web application, you can type in your schedule and click on the save button.       
The date is shown on the top of the web application.       
 The time blocks are separated into three colors.
 The grey color means the time of those time blocks is in the past. The red color means the time 
 of those time blocks is in the present. The green color means the time of those time blocks is in the future.    
If you refresh the page, your daily schedule will be shown.
